# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a basic tic-tac-toe program written in C. The program allows the user to play against a computer that plays randomly. At the end of each game, the program asks the user if they want to play again.
(PS: This code was mainly done following a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_889aB2D1KI&t=23s) as i didnt have much experience with C)

## How to Play:
To play the game, simply run the program in your favorite C compiler. The program will prompt the user to enter the coordinates of their move (e.g. "Enter row and column (1-3): "). The computer will then make its move, and the game will continue until either the user or the computer wins or the game ends in a tie.

## Contributing
This program currently has a basic implementation where the computer plays randomly. If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to create a pull request to add more advanced gameplay functionality, such as creating an algorithm for the computer to play more intelligently.
