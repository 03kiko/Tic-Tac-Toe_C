# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic tic-tac-toe program in C.

# How does it work?
It's a basic program in C that I did to learn a bit more of C, the user plays against a computer that plays randomly and at the end asks the user if he wants to play again.

# Contributing:
The computer plays randomly the next step would make it play more intelligently so feel free to do a pull request!
